# MultiomicsML project

Imperial College London, MRes Bioinformatics and Theoretical Systems Biology
Semester 2 Project: Enhancing the PathIntegrate Workflow for multi-omics data integration and machine learning

## Aims and Objectives

Aims:

The current MetaboAnalyst method for molecular ID conversion of compounds is limited in scope, mapping less than half of metabolite names to ChEBI IDs. Publicly available, manually curated pathway databases are sparse for metabolic compounds, with bias toward proteomics data in multi-omics analysis. PathIntegrate uses pathway-based supervised methods for classification modelling, so improve ID and subsequent pathway mapping can strengthen analysis. However, labelled data may not capture the heterogenous nature patient phenotypes, highlighting the need for an unsupervised framework. 

* A) We aim to use LLM-based semantic searching to map more metabolite names to IDs, widening the scope of pathway analysis.
    
* B) We aim to apply novel pathway databases augmented with metabolites using deep learning [45], to facilitate more comprehensive pathway mapping and attain more robust biological predictions. 
    
* C) We aim to develop an extension to PathIntegrate which will provide the user an unsupervised utility for pathway-based multivariate analysis that can be benchmarked with synthetic data simulations.
